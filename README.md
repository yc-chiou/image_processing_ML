# image_processing_ML

## What is this project about?
This is solar cell research to understand patterned ARC impact on its efficiency. This study aims to understand the textured surface of ARC by using the python-meep simulation tool. Users could specify the desired parameters(pattern sharp, width, depth, symmetry).

## Repository structure
- Six models of surface

## Run
- Place images on the folder along with the python script
- Run python rgb.py via cmd
- follow

## Experimental results
